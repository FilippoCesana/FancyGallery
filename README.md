# FancyGallery
Web Atelier 3 Project

This project will develop an online gallery where photographers can upload pictures and users can watch, like, and save them. 

While this is the final goal, we will start this project by implementing an easier version, where at the index page it will be possible to choose between 'user' and 'photographer': according to which one of the two the viewer chooses, the website will answer differently. Of course, to access as one of the two, a particular password will be reaquired. With 'user', it will be only possible to watch several galleries of events and to look for a picture with a particular id. On the other hand, by logging in as a photographer, the viewer will be able to upload pictures, delete them, create galleries and so on. We will firstly work on this easier version and, later, if time stays on our side, we will implement the more advanced version, which ultimately will be very similar to a social media, such as Instagram, with the fundamental difference that normal users will only be able to search for pictures, watch them and save them as favorites.
